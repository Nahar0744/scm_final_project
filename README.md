- Minimal styling using CSS
- Bootstrap components for responsiveness

### Version 2: Enhanced Navigation and Filtering

In the second version, we've improved the user experience by adding:

- A navigation bar with links to different page (e.g., Reservation,Jobs,Events,etc.)
- Active page indicators to highlight the current section
- Enhanced styling using Bootstrap components

### Version 3: Dynamic Search and Filtering

Our latest version introduces dynamic features using JavaScript:

- Users can now search for specific dishes
- Filter recipes based on criteria (e.g., cuisine type, dietary preferences)
